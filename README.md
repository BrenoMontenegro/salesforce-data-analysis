# Salesforce Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the GlobalVision Systems & Data Intern Take-Home Challenge.
The objective of the project is to process, analyze, and extract insights from two anonymized Salesforce datasets using Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques.

The analysis explores support case patterns, account characteristics, and operational KPIs, ultimately generating actionable business recommendations.

## Objectives of the Challenge
- 1: Data Exploration
  - Load both datasets using Python
  - Inspect structure, content, and data quality
- 2: Data Processing
  - Use SQL within Python (SQLite / pandasql)
  - Join datasets and compute relevant KPIs
- 3: Data Visualization
  - Create visualizations that support insight generation
- 4: Business Insights
  - Summarize key findings
  - Propose actionable recommendations
- 5: Presentation
  - Record a video of up to 5 minutes explaining the solution

All items above are addressed in the notebook.

## Data Sources
1. accounts_anonymized.json
   - Contains general details about Salesforce accounts
2. support_cases_anonymized.json
   - Contains support case information

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- SQLite (via sqlite3) for SQL queries
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Video Presentation
A short 5-minute walkthrough demonstrating the notebook execution and insights is included or will be added as video_presentation.mp4

## How to run the Notebook
Option 1 - Google Colab Notebook 
  - 1: Upload the notebook and both datasets
  - 2: Run all cells sequentially

Option 2 - Local Jupyter Notebook
  - 1: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  - 2: Open the notebook and run all cells.
